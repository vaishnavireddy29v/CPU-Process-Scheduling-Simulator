The implementation of the CPU scheduling algorithms is an automation that provides efficient and errorless computation of waiting times, turnaround times, finishing times and normalized turnaround times of First Come First Served (FCFS), Shortest Process Next (SPN), Shortest Remaining Time (SRT), Round-Robin (RR), and Priority Scheduling algorithms. The system provides a clean and convenient way to test the given data and do the analysis of the CPU scheduling algorithms mentioned above. For the purpose of analysis and testing, the user first specifies each process along with its information such as arrival times and service times and then FCFS, SPN, SRT, RR, or Priority can be computed producing output in appropriate format for readability.
